Simplify interface. ParamValue is for internal use. 
Consider not using variants, because it seems more confusing than useful.
Instead, ParamValue could hold two strings: type and value.

Hide usage of ParamValue to the library user. For example in class Param, there should
not be ParamValue as arguments. Even more so with variants (if we keep them).

Connect this with Runner.

Use namespace NOMAD on parameter classes
Make all internal members start with m_* instead of _*

Compile on Windows. Asses usage of boost.

Some complex types to think about: 
X0 can be either a NOMAD::Point or a filename
std::list<std::string> DISPLAY_STATS
int[2] LH_SEARCH
etc. This is another reason to use strings instead of variants in ParamValue.
